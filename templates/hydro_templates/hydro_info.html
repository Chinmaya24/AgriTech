<h2>What is Hydroponics?</h2>
<p>Hydroponics is a method of growing plants without soil by using nutrient-rich water solutions and inert media. This approach enables precise control over nutrients, pH, and environmental conditions to optimize plant growth.</p>
<p>Hydroponics is a type of horticulture and a subset of hydroculture which involves growing plants, usually crops or medicinal plants, without soil, by using water-based mineral nutrient solutions in an artificial environment. Terrestrial or aquatic plants may grow freely with their roots exposed to the nutritious liquid or the roots may be mechanically supported by an inert medium such as perlite, gravel, or other substrates</p>
<p>Despite inert media, roots can cause changes of the rhizosphere pH and root exudates can affect rhizosphere biology and physiological balance of the nutrient solution when secondary metabolites are produced in plants. Transgenic plants grown hydroponically allow the release of pharmaceutical proteins as part of the root exudate into the hydroponic medium</p>
<p>The nutrients used in hydroponic systems can come from many different organic or inorganic sources, including fish excrement, duck manure, purchased chemical fertilizers, or artificial standard or hybrid nutrient solutions.</p>
<p>In contrast to field cultivation, plants are commonly grown hydroponically in a greenhouse or contained environment on inert media, adapted to the controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) process.[7] Plants commonly grown hydroponically include tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, strawberries, lettuces, and cannabis, usually for commercial use, as well as Arabidopsis thaliana, which serves as a model organism in plant science and genetics</p>
<p>Hydroponics offers many advantages, notably a decrease in water usage in agriculture. To grow 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) of tomatoes using

  intensive farming methods requires 214 liters (47 imp gal; 57 U.S. gal) of water;[9]
  using hydroponics, 70 liters (15 imp gal; 18 U.S. gal); and
  only 20 liters (4.4 imp gal; 5.3 U.S. gal) using aeroponics.</p>
<p>Hydroponic cultures lead to highest biomass and protein production compared to other growth substrates, of plants cultivated in the same environmental conditions and supplied with equal amounts of nutrients.</p>
<p>Hydroponics is not only used on earth, but has also proven itself in plant production experiments in Earth orbit</p>

<h2>Water & Fertilizer Usage</h2>
<p>In hydroponics, water and fertilizer usage is highly efficient, making it one of the most sustainable farming methods available today. Unlike traditional soil-based agriculture, hydroponic systems use up to 90% less water because water is continuously recirculated and delivered directly to the plant roots, ensuring maximum absorption and minimal wastage. Evaporation and runoff are significantly reduced, which makes hydroponics particularly suitable for areas facing water scarcity or drought conditions. Fertilizers in hydroponics are supplied as a carefully balanced nutrient solution, providing plants with the exact amounts of essential minerals they need at each stage of growth. This precision reduces overall fertilizer consumption and eliminates nutrient loss into the environment, preventing soil and water pollution. Additionally, the ability to adjust nutrient concentrations for different crops and growth phases allows plants to grow faster, healthier, and more uniformly. By combining efficient water use with precise nutrient delivery, hydroponics not only increases crop yields but also promotes environmentally responsible, cost-effective, and sustainable farming, making it an ideal solution for modern agriculture and urban farming initiatives.</p>
